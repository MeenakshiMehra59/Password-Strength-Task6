# Step 4 – Research & Short Explanations

## 1. Common Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – An attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. Short and simple passwords are cracked quickly.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Instead of trying all combinations, attackers use a list of common passwords and words (like "password", "123456", "qwerty") to guess faster.

## 2. Why Length Matters
The longer the password, the harder it is to crack. Each extra character multiplies the number of possible combinations, making it take exponentially longer for attackers.  
Example:  
- 6-character lowercase password → cracked in seconds.  
- 14-character mixed password → could take centuries to crack.

## 3. What’s MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
MFA requires more than just your password to log in, such as:
- A one-time code sent to your phone or email.
- A fingerprint or face scan.  
Even if your password is stolen, MFA keeps your account secure.

## 4. Password Managers
A password manager is a secure tool that stores all your passwords in an encrypted vault. You only need to remember one master password, and it can:
- Generate strong, unique passwords.
- Auto-fill logins securely.  
Examples: **Bitwarden**, **1Password**, **LastPass**.
