# Password Strength Analysis – Task 6

## Introduction
This task focuses on testing passwords of varying complexities using online password strength checkers. The goal is to understand what makes a password strong, learn about common password attacks, and discover security best practices.

## Passwords Tested

| Password              | Score / Rating  | Crack Time        | Feedback                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| apple123              | Weak            | Instant           | Too short, contains common word        |
| Appl3$tree            | Medium          | Few hours         | Decent complexity, needs more length   |
| P@ssw0rd!2025#Learn   | Strong          | Centuries         | Complex and long, very secure          |
| My$ecureP@ss2025!     | Very Strong     | Centuries+        | Excellent length and complexity        |

## Step 4 – Research & Short Explanations

### 1. Common Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Tries every possible character combination until the password is guessed.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Uses a list of common passwords/words to guess faster.

### 2. Why Length Matters
Each extra character increases the number of possible combinations exponentially, making it far harder to crack.  
Example:  
- 6 characters → seconds to crack.  
- 14 characters with mix → centuries to crack.

### 3. What’s MFA
Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra step (like OTP, fingerprint, or face scan) to keep accounts secure even if passwords are stolen.

### 4. Password Managers
Secure tools that store and auto-fill strong passwords. Examples: **Bitwarden**, **1Password**, **LastPass**.

## Analysis – Best Practices Learned
1. Use at least 12–16 characters.
2. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3. Avoid dictionary words and personal information.
4. Use unique passwords for each account.
5. Enable MFA wherever possible.
6. Use a password manager for convenience and security.

## Conclusion
Strong, long, and unique passwords combined with MFA and password managers provide maximum protection against brute force and dictionary attacks.
